**MISSION:** Our mission is to motivate millennials to fulfill their lifetime dreams/aspirations, and as a result live a more satisfied life.


**PROBLEM:** Many of us have items on our bucket lists that may never be checked off because we think that we have all the time in the world to check off each item. 


**SOLUTION:** We propose BLINK™ a life-expectancy app that calculates how many years you have left to complete each item on the bucket list based on your age and gender as well as make recommendations for what to include in your bucket list.  

***
**SCOPE:** Build a React app with the following scope:
Login
Create user account with email, password, DOB, gender
Based on your age and gender an API (TDB) will calculate your life-expectancy 
Search to look up your bucket list items from a Travel API (TDB)
Save your bucket list item
Delete your bucket list item
Calculation how much time you have left to complete a bucket list item
List of all your bucket list items

React front end that consumes that API
